# OSX Setup

**Notice:** Not maintained any more, see [dsager/dotfiles](https://github.com/dsager/dotfiles) instead...

Some stuff to setup and customize OSX. It's opinionated and a constant WIP, but
feel free to take over what you like...

## Usage

    git clone git@github.com:dsager/osx_setup.git
    ./osx_setup/setup.sh

The sub scripts in `installers/` can all be run on their own as well.

## Command Line Tools for Xcode

- Get them from https://developer.apple.com/downloads
- Set the path with `xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
- Remove Xcode via app cleaner

## Acknowledgements

Most of this was copied shamelessly from
[dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and
[osx-for-hackers.sh](https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465). Thanks guys!
